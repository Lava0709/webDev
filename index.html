        <p> First of all, it is necessary to explain why we have chosen this title Public Digital Backbone? The title "Public Digital Backbone" embodies the essence of India's digital transformation journey. Just as the backbone is central to the human body, connecting and supporting various parts, this digital backbone serves as the core support system for various digital initiatives in India. It's more than just a network or infrastructure; it's the very foundation that upholds and empowers the nation's digital ecosystem. This backbone doesn't merely provide services but creates an environment where different platforms, services, and stakeholders come together, flourish, and evolve. It gives everyone, from citizens, government entities to private sectors, the freedom to build upon and customize it, reflecting the inclusivity and democratic nature of the initiative. By naming the book "Public Digital Backbone", we want to highlight this initiative's pivotal role in driving India's digital progress, fostering innovation, and ensuring benefits reach every citizen.</p>
